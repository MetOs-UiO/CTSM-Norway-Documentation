CTSM-Norway
=========================

The documentation on this webpage is made to help users of the clusters offered by `Sigma2 <https://www.sigma2.no/>`__ to run and contribute to the development of the `Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM) <https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM>`__. 

Our mission is not to duplicate the information you can find in CTSM's `documentation <https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/index.html>`__, 
and NorESM's `documentation <https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configurations/clm.html>`__, but rather offer some up-to-date guidelines of best practices for running and developing CTSM and CTSM-FATES with examples that are specific for the Norwegian cluster.



.. Note :: 
   This documentation is not meant to be static and is a collaborative effort of the total team. 
   If you spot anything wrong or would like to add information to the documentation, 
   please check out our `contribution guide <https://metos-uio.github.io/CTSM-Norway-Documentation/contribution/#contribution>`__ and send us a pull request or file an
   issue in `our <https://github.com/MetOs-UiO/CTSM-Norway-Documentation/issues>`_ repository.
