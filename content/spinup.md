# Spin-up CTSM
The idea behind doing a so-called **spin-up** is to reach an
equilibrium state in your model. Typically any perturbation (e.g. 2x CO2) experiment starts from such a state.

Running our perturbed system into equilibrium again will give you
the maximum impact of the perturbation.

### Which variables are important to check?
Since we are interested in the equilibrium state of our system, the
"slowest" variables matter the most (e.g. terrestrial soil
carbon).

#### BioGeoChemistry mode 
If you are running in BioGeoChemistry (BGC) mode, it is important to
check the *health* of your vegetation. The variable directly associated with the health
is `Total Leaf Area
Index (TLAI)`. 

If `TLAI=0` your vegetation is dead and something went really
wrong.

### How long should a spin-up be?
The overall duration (years before an equilibrium state is reached)
varies. As mentioned above, the variables with the slowest turnover rate
will define the time you'd need to spend for your spin-up.

The rule of thumb for single-cell simulation is the higher the
latitude the longer the spin-up. Spinning up a single cell case in the Tropics will approximately
take 2x100 years after which the terrestrial carbon pools are in
equilibrium (Fig.1). In the polar regions, this means that the spin-up time is a couple of 1000 years!

### What does equilibrium mean?
Typically you'd cycle through a range of given meteorological
years - referred to as time-slice (e.g. 1990-2000).

After an initial rapid increase/decrease in your variables, you will
start to see the interannual variability of the chosen time slice
(wiggling). Equilibrium is reached as soon as consecutive time slices differ by
less than a threshold that you have to choose (\< 0.1-1%).

## How to perform a spin-up?
Usually, we do a two-staged spin-up. See the necessary XML change commands below (NB you have to stand in the folder where you created your case for this to work!).
